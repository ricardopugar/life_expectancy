Life Expectancy Prediction using Neural Networks
This project applies deep learning techniques to predict life expectancy based on various health and socioeconomic factors. It uses Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras to preprocess the data, train a neural network model, and evaluate its performance.
Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- Neural Network Model: A sequential model with one hidden layer and ReLU activation.
- Model Training: Optimized using the Adam optimizer with MSE and MAE metrics.
- Evaluation: Uses test data to analyze performance and prediction accuracy.
Technologies Used:
- pandas for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for preprocessing and splitting data
- TensorFlow/Keras for neural network implementation
Dataset:
The model is trained on the life_expectancy.csv dataset, which contains various country-level indicators related to life expectancy.
Future Improvements:
- Adding more layers and tuning hyperparameters.
- Exploring other preprocessing techniques like normalization.
- Visualizing results with graphs for better insights.
